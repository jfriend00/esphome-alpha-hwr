  // These fields were called `obj_id` and `sub_id` for a long time, and that is
  // not what they are. A pump response contains NO Object ID and NO Sub-ID: the
  // request names an object, and the reply identifies only the object's TYPE.
  // Measured over the 21,236 captured Class 10 responses long enough to carry a
  // type header, byte 6 is 0x00 in 100% of
  // them, and bytes 7-8 identify the type of the object the request asked for.
  // Note the reply is not echoing anything: a read request is
  // `0A 03 [obj] [subH] [subL]` and carries no type at all.
  //
  //   byte:   5        6     7       8       9        10..12
  //         [length] [00] [TypeH] [TypeL] [Version] [size(3)]  payload...
  //
  // So the two values below split the type at the wrong boundary, for
  // historical reasons this code preserves rather than fixes:
  //
  //   packet_type_high    = TypeH                  (the type's high byte)
  //   packet_type_low_ver = (TypeL << 8) | Version
  //
  // which is why the match constants elsewhere look like Object IDs but are
  // not. Each is (TypeL << 8) | Version, and the type's HIGH byte is the
  // separate expect_type_high value:
  //
  //   0xF301  Type  243 v1  event log info      wire 00 00 F3 01
  //   0xF402  Type  244 v2  event log entry     wire 00 00 F4 02
  //   0xDE01  Type  222 v1  schedule entries    wire 00 00 DE 01
  //   0xDC01  Type  220 v1  single event        wire 00 00 DC 01
  //   0x2F01  Type  303 v1  mode / control      wire 00 01 2F 01
  //
  // Note that (TypeL << 8) | Version does NOT identify a type on its own:
  // Type 1012 (the temperature-range user settings object) also ends in
  // F4 02, but its wire header is 00 03 F4 02 -- it differs from Type 244
  // only in expect_type_high. An earlier version of this comment recorded
  // 0xF402 as "Type 1012", which is precisely the confusion this block
  // exists to prevent.
  //
  // The consequence that matters: matching here discriminates object TYPES, not
  // instances of a type. Sibling reads that share a type -- the five schedule
  // layers (Sub 1000..1004), the single-event slots, the event-log entries, the
  // Object 53 trends -- are byte-identical through this header and cannot be
  // told apart by it. Verified against the captures: obj 84 sub 1000-1004 all
  // answer 00 00 DE 01, obj 84 sub 900-904 all answer 00 00 DC 01, and obj 88
  // sub 10200-10219 all answer 00 00 F4 02.
  //
  // Byte 5 is likewise not an operation code in the response direction: it is
  // the APDU body length. `byte5 == total_len - 8` held for all 24,233 CRC-valid
  // captured inbound frames without exception -- but read that as "every frame
  // in that corpus carries exactly one APDU", which is what it actually says. A
  // telegram may carry several, and then byte 5 is the FIRST APDU's length and
  // the equality does not hold (issue #226). It is still called `opspec` below
  // because the matching logic keys off specific values of it.

      // Object 86 Sub 7 mode read passing its two arguments the wrong way
      // round, which is fixed at that call site.

      // It was not the mode read's alone, though. Instrumenting it shows a
      // second caller in the host suite: test_write_operations builds the
      // Obj 91 Sub 430 reply echoing 91/430 at bytes 6-9, which puts 0x005B in
      // packet_type_high and matches an expectation of 91. That fixture does
      // not describe the real pump -- captured Sub 430 replies carry the
      // ordinary type header 00 03 F4 02 (442 samples) -- and the Obj-91
      // workaround branch below catches it identically, so removing this
      // changes no behaviour. Recorded because the deletion was first

      // disproved.

    // (0x15 for the 14-byte Sub 430 temperature-range settings, 0x0D for the
    // 6-byte Sub 421 DHW on/off configuration -- bench/capture-verified, see
    // issue #106) which does NOT carry the standard Obj/Sub IDs in the payload
    // header. Python reference simply accepted these via a wildcard match and
    // sliced at byte 10. We explicitly handle the known cases here to avoid
    // wildcard matching other packets.
    // Obj 91 config reads. NOTE these two fields are used here as the REQUEST's
    // object and sub-id (91 / 430 / 421), not as expected response type fields,
    // so this branch matches on what was asked for plus the reply's length byte.
    //
    // Not because the reply lacks a type header -- it has an ordinary one
    // (Sub 430 answers 00 03 F4 02, Sub 421 answers 00 03 D9 01, 442 and 563
    // captured samples). The reason is only that these call sites pass the
    // object and sub-id rather than the expected type, so the normal path has
    // nothing to compare. Giving them their real type expectations would let
