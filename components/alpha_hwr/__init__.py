    the same value and installs cannot be correlated with behavior changes in
    Home Assistant history — which is how a three-day outage went unattributed.

    ESPHome clones `github://` sources with git, and a `type: local` source is
    the developer's working tree, so both resolve here (a shallow clone without
    tags still yields the commit via `--always`). Any failure — no git, tarball
    install, unreadable directory — degrades to "unknown"; the firmware build
    timestamp published alongside it still separates installs. A diagnostic must
