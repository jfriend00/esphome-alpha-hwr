# Notes About This Fork

This is a fork from https://github.com/eman/esphome-alpha-hwr (the upstream repository).  That repository appears to be a work in progress tagged as v0.4.0 (as of Juune 2026) and the code has many things broken in it.  This fork fixes enough of the issues for me to use it to control my Grundfos Alpha HWR 15-29 SU/T pump in one operating mode (constant speed). I'm using the pump for home hot water recirc and control is configured as:

```Home Assistant > Ethernet > ESP32-S3 > Bluetooth > Pump```

I'm using a Home Assistant driven schedule and only using the pump's capabilities to control the pump speed and on/off, none of the other built-in features of the pump (like its own scheduling or auto modes).  The biggest things that this fixes are bluetooth pairing and connection issues (the upstream repository would routinely drop the bluetooth pairing bond, requiring a trip outside to the pump to put it back in pairing mode).  On top of that, getting the ESP32 paired with the pump could sometimes take as long as 30 minutes.  Those issues have been fixed in this fork and a PR back to the upstream repository has been proposed in a comment, but has not received a response.  So, for now, I will just continue to improve this repository fixing things as needed for my use - not attempting general fixes to all the things that are broken.

Many features are broken in this code, many others have not been used or tested in my implementation.  But, pump speed, pump on/off and important telemetry works.  I've added several new sensors that give you the precise state of the Bluetooth connection (though the connection is now stable for me through ESP32 power cycles and reboots, through Home Assistant restarts and through pump power cycles).  It used to drop the Bluetooth pairing on every pump power cycle, it does not do that any more and appears to run unattended, recovering automatically from whatever issues I've thrown at it.

For a note about the fixes in this fork, see [docs/UPSTREAM_NOTES.md](docs/UPSTREAM_NOTES.md).

I am only using the apha_hwr_pairing and alpha_hwr_controls packages.

To use this like I am, you would add these two blocks to your device YAML.  The first is to replace the links in the upstream package so they point to this repository.  The second is a new sensor for controlling the recric speed (the existing one is broken and works in a fundamentally different way that didn't seem worth fixing for my use).

    step: 50
    initial_value: 1650
    restore_value: true       # <-- the key line: survives reboot via NVS
    mode: slider
```

These have to be combined with all the other YAML to bring your device up and running and you need to put the pump into constant speed mode and then it will set the speed that you configure in this above Recirc Speed control.  Do not rely on the upstream speed control as it is not wired up properly.

If there's interest I can write more doc with my sample ESP32 YAML that works.  Just file an issue if you need more info.  All development has been done on the bt_issues branch which is reflected in the above YAML links.

# ESPHome ALPHA HWR + DHW Demand


ESPHome repository for two custom components:

- `alpha_hwr` — BLE telemetry and control for the Grundfos ALPHA HWR pump
- `dhw_demand` — on-device DHW demand detection using pump telemetry and/or
  Home Assistant sensors

The repo also ships reusable package YAML so an external ESPHome config can pull
in the component stack directly from GitHub.

## What each package does

| Package | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/alpha_hwr_base.yaml` | Basic ALPHA HWR telemetry without BLE pairing | Good starting point for read-only monitoring |
| `packages/alpha_hwr_pairing.yaml` | Full telemetry, diagnostics, schedules, and paired BLE access | Required for controls and schedule editing |
| `packages/alpha_hwr_controls.yaml` | Recommended control UI | Adds pump enable, remote mode, schedule toggle, mode select, and setpoint controls |
| `packages/alpha_hwr_schedule.yaml` | Lighter schedule/remote/mode UI | Simpler alternative to `alpha_hwr_controls.yaml`; avoid combining both unless you want duplicate controls |
| `packages/alpha_hwr_schedule_editor.yaml` | ESPHome services and helper entities for weekly/single-event editing | Pair with `alpha_hwr_pairing.yaml` |
| `packages/dhw_demand_detector.yaml` | DHW detector outputs plus Home Assistant supplementary sensors | Works standalone or alongside `alpha_hwr` |

## Requirements

- **alpha_hwr**: ESP32-class board with BLE (`ESP32`, `ESP32-C3`, `ESP32-S3`)
- **dhw_demand standalone**: any ESPHome-capable board if you only use Home
  Assistant-fed sensors
- `substitutions.mac_address` for the pump packages
- `api:` enabled if you want Home Assistant services/entities
- `framework.type: esp-idf` is strongly recommended for BLE-based ALPHA HWR
  nodes

## Basic vs paired `alpha_hwr`

| Feature | `alpha_hwr_base.yaml` | `alpha_hwr_pairing.yaml` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flow, head, water temperature, RPM, power | Yes | Yes |
| AC/DC voltage, motor current | No | Yes |
| Inlet pressure | No | Yes |
| PCB and control-box temperatures | No | Yes |
| Pairing status | No | Yes |
| Control mode text sensor | No | Yes |
| Schedule and single-event text sensors | No | Yes |
| Start/stop, remote control, schedule toggle, mode/setpoint UI | No | Add `alpha_hwr_controls.yaml` or `alpha_hwr_schedule.yaml` |
| Device info, history, event log, statistics | No | Yes |

## Using these packages from an external ESPHome config

The package URLs below are meant to be used from another ESPHome project. The
package files already pull the required external components for `alpha_hwr`.

### 1. Basic read-only pump telemetry

```yaml
esphome:
  name: hwr-pump
  friendly_name: HWR Pump

substitutions:
  mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"

packages:
  alpha_hwr: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/alpha_hwr_base.yaml@main

esp32:
  board: esp32-c3-devkitm-1
  variant: esp32c3
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

api:
  encryption:
    key: !secret api_key

ota:
  - platform: esphome
    password: !secret ota_password
```

### 2. Full telemetry plus control UI

```yaml
esphome:
  name: hwr-pump
  friendly_name: HWR Pump

substitutions:
  mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"

packages:
  alpha_hwr: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/alpha_hwr_pairing.yaml@main
  alpha_hwr_controls: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/alpha_hwr_controls.yaml@main

esp32:
  board: esp32-c3-devkitm-1
  variant: esp32c3
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

api:
  encryption:
    key: !secret api_key

ota:
  - platform: esphome
    password: !secret ota_password
```

### 3. Add schedule editor services

Add the schedule editor package on top of the paired pump config:

```yaml
packages:
  alpha_hwr: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/alpha_hwr_pairing.yaml@main
  alpha_hwr_controls: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/alpha_hwr_controls.yaml@main
  alpha_hwr_schedule_editor: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/alpha_hwr_schedule_editor.yaml@main
```

`alpha_hwr_schedule_editor.yaml` exposes ESPHome services such as
`set_schedule_entry` and `set_single_event`.

### 4. Standalone `dhw_demand`

When you use `dhw_demand` without `alpha_hwr`, declare the component explicitly
with `external_components`:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: dhw-detector
  friendly_name: DHW Detector

substitutions:
  flow_entity: sensor.droplet_flow_rate
  tank_lower_temp_entity: sensor.tank_lower_temperature
  dhw_charge_entity: sensor.dhw_charge

external_components:
  - source: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr@main
    components: [dhw_demand]

packages:
  dhw_demand: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/dhw_demand_detector.yaml@main

esp32:
  board: esp32dev

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

api:
ota:
  - platform: esphome
```

### 5. Combined `alpha_hwr` + `dhw_demand`

If you want pump telemetry plus DHW demand detection, combine the packages and
wire the pump sensors into the detector:

```yaml
packages:
  alpha_hwr: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/alpha_hwr_pairing.yaml@main
  alpha_hwr_controls: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/alpha_hwr_controls.yaml@main
  dhw_demand: github://eman/esphome-alpha-hwr/packages/dhw_demand_detector.yaml@main

alpha_hwr:
  current:
    id: motor_current_sensor
  power:
    id: pump_power_sensor
  rpm:
    id: motor_speed_sensor
  flow:
    id: flow_rate_sensor
  inlet_pressure:
    id: inlet_pressure_sensor
  head_rate:
    id: pump_head_rate_sensor

sensor:
  - platform: copy
    source_id: flow_rate_sensor
    id: dhw_pump_flow_gpm
    internal: true
    unit_of_measurement: "GPM"
    filters:
      - multiply: 4.40287

  - platform: copy
    source_id: inlet_pressure_sensor
    id: dhw_inlet_pressure_psi
    internal: true
    unit_of_measurement: "PSI"
    filters:
      - multiply: 14.5038

dhw_demand:
  motor_speed: motor_speed_sensor
  motor_current: motor_current_sensor
  inlet_pressure: dhw_inlet_pressure_psi
  pump_flow: dhw_pump_flow_gpm
  pump_power: pump_power_sensor
  pump_head_rate: pump_head_rate_sensor
```

For a complete working version, see `dhw-demand-example.yaml`.

## Local development override

When you are working from a local clone and want ESPHome to build the local
component sources instead of the cached GitHub copy, add:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: local
      path: components
    components: [alpha_hwr, dhw_demand]
```

That is the pattern used in `dhw-demand-example.yaml`.

## Schedule services and entity names

`alpha_hwr_schedule_editor.yaml` creates ESPHome services. Home Assistant sees
them as:

- `esphome.<node_name>_set_schedule_entry`
- `esphome.<node_name>_clear_schedule_entry`
- `esphome.<node_name>_set_schedule_enabled`
- `esphome.<node_name>_refresh_schedule`
- `esphome.<node_name>_set_single_event`
- `esphome.<node_name>_clear_single_event`
- `esphome.<node_name>_refresh_single_events`

`<node_name>` comes from `esphome.name` with `-` converted to `_`. Example:

- `esphome.name: hwr-pump`
- Home Assistant service: `esphome.hwr_pump_set_schedule_entry`

The paired package also publishes schedule text sensors using the same node-name
prefix, for example `text_sensor.hwr_pump_weekly_schedule`.

More detail and automation examples are in
[`docs/schedule-management.md`](docs/schedule-management.md).

## Pairing

`alpha_hwr_pairing.yaml` enables BLE pairing and stores the bond in NVS. Typical
first-time flow:

1. Put the pump into Bluetooth pairing mode.
2. Flash the ESPHome node with the paired package.
3. Watch logs for the authentication/pairing sequence to complete.

After that, reconnects reuse the stored bond.

## Examples in this repo

- `hwr-pump-example.yaml` — basic read-only `alpha_hwr`
- `hwr-pairing-example.yaml` — paired `alpha_hwr`
- `hwr-pump-schedule-example.yaml` — paired pump with schedule UI/services
- `dhw-demand-example.yaml` — combined `alpha_hwr` + `dhw_demand` with local
  component override
- `hwr-pump.yaml` — real hardware config used for local verification

## Optional Lovelace schedule card

The schedule card source ships in this repo at
`homeassistant/www/alpha-hwr-schedule-card.js`. It is a separate Home Assistant
frontend resource, so ESPHome does not install it automatically.

### Prerequisites

- Use `alpha_hwr_pairing.yaml` so Home Assistant gets the weekly schedule and
  single-event text sensors.
- Use `alpha_hwr_schedule_editor.yaml` so Home Assistant gets the
  `esphome.<node_name>_*` services the card calls when you edit schedules.

### Install the card in Home Assistant

1. Copy `homeassistant/www/alpha-hwr-schedule-card.js` from this repo into your
   Home Assistant `www` directory.
   - Home Assistant OS / Supervised: usually `/config/www/alpha-hwr-schedule-card.js`
   - Container installs: copy it into the mounted config directory under `www/`
2. In Home Assistant, open **Settings → Dashboards → Resources** and add:
   - **URL**: `/local/alpha-hwr-schedule-card.js`
   - **Resource type**: `JavaScript Module`
3. Refresh the browser, or reload the frontend resources if Home Assistant does
   not pick up the new card immediately.

### Lovelace example

```yaml
type: custom:alpha-hwr-schedule-card
title: Pump Schedule
device: hwr_pump
entity: text_sensor.hwr_pump_weekly_schedule
single_events_entity: text_sensor.hwr_pump_single_events
```

### Choosing the right names

- `device` must match the ESPHome node-derived service prefix: `esphome.name`
  with `-` converted to `_`.
- `entity` should point at the weekly schedule text sensor from the paired
  package.
- `single_events_entity` is optional, but enables the card's quick-run and
  single-event display features.

For example, if `esphome.name: hwr-pump`, then Home Assistant service names use
`hwr_pump`, so the card config should use:

- `device: hwr_pump`
- `entity: text_sensor.hwr_pump_weekly_schedule`
- `single_events_entity: text_sensor.hwr_pump_single_events`
